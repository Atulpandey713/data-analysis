# data-analysis
This repository demonstrates practical data analysis with Python, focusing on transforming raw data into meaningful insights. It includes step-by-step examples of data cleaning, preprocessing, exploration, and visualization, using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn

## data analysis using pandas
This repository focuses on data analysis using Pandas, a core Python library for data manipulation and exploration. It covers every stage of the analysis process — from importing and cleaning data to aggregating, filtering, and visualizing it for better decision-making Importing and handling various data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)  Cleaning

## data analysis using numpy

🧮 Data Analysis Using NumPy
This project demonstrates how to perform efficient data analysis using NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library in Python. It covers essential operations such as data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and statistical computation using NumPy arrays. The project highlights how NumPy’s vectorized operations and broadcasting capabilities enable fast and memory-efficient data manipulation, making it an ideal foundation for scientific computing and data analytics.
